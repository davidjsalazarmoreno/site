Next year, January 2023, it will be 10 years since I started working as a Self Taught Software Developer, a decade has passed and now I just want to let out a lot of stuff from my chest, share my experience and help others in their road, plus improve my English skill which is not my primary language.

And whatâ€™s better for that than a blog/Twitter or youtube channel?, this is just a post for saying Hi and welcome to this journey.

Let's get our knowledge to the next level!
