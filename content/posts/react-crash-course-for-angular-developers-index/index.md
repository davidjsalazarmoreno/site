I recently talked with a colleague who is an Angular specialist but was looking to learn React to add one more tool to his portfolio. We were talking about similar ways to do the same thing in Angular and React and the idea for this article came: how about a React Crash Course for Angular Developers? In the end, it is Frontend or UI development, most of the knowledge is transferable.


We will divide the course into topics and how things are done in Angular and then the React counterpart side by side.


This is an intensive-turbo-crash course, which means that I'll be assuming you are familiar with a lot of Web Development concepts but if not, I'll be adding reference links at the end of each chapter, let's begin.
