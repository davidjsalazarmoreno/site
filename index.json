Real vs virtual DOM, by altexsoft One of the main differences between React and Angular is that with the latter you get a lot of out-the-box: a Router, HTTP request client, Pipes, Directives, etc.\nBut React main responsibility is to allow you to build and render your IU components, and it does that using a data structure called virtual DOM and reconciliation algorithm.\nHow does React work? # Virtual DOM and the reconciliation algorithm # Virtual DOM is a data structure built to mimic the real DOM with one difference:\nA virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing\u0026rsquo;s power to directly change what\u0026rsquo;s on the screen, Codecademy. The thing is that operations to update the real DOM are generally expensive in memory.\nWhen you update the component state in React these changes are applied to the virtual DOM, then it’s time for the reconciliation algorithm (or diffing algorithm) to compare the changes between the virtual DOM and the Real DOM.\nFinally, it will apply and update the changes only to those objects and only those objects in the Real DOM.\nif you’re familiar with Git, you could think of DOM as your main branch, Virtual DOM as your Develop branch, and the reconciliation algorithm as your Pull Request, it’s not exactly the same but it’s a mental model that makes it easier to understand the concept.\nVirtual DOM and the reconciliation algorithm, by brainhub React can update only the necessary parts of the DOM. React’s reputation for performance comes largely from this innovation, Codecademy. Also, this abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app according.\nNext Chapter: Components in React vs Angular (Next week) # For now, this is enough of React’s architecture, later in the course, we’re going to revisit it expanding it with more stuff like React Fiber and other interesting things.\nIn the next chapter, we’re going to check the side-by-side differences between React and Angular components: the basics, local state management, component life cycles, and basic styling.\nIf would like to know when the next chapter in this course gets released, please subscribe to my newsletter at the end of this page.\nLearn more # Virtual DOM and Internals React: The Virtual DOM React Fiber Architecture Is React a Library or a Framework?

We were talking about similar ways to do the same thing in Angular and React and the idea for this article came: how about a React Crash Course for Angular Developers? In the end, it is Frontend or UI development, most of the knowledge is transferable.\nWe will divide the course into topics and how things are done in Angular and then the React counterpart side by side.\nThis is an intensive-turbo-crash course, which means that I\u0026rsquo;ll be assuming you are familiar with a lot of Web Development concepts but if not, I\u0026rsquo;ll be adding reference links at the end of each chapter, let\u0026rsquo;s begin.\nTable of content (Work in progress) # React Architecture.

Final UI Design, check ✅. Clear and defined scope through acceptance criteria, fail 🔴. Unknown check: Dependencies, feasibility, follow-up tickets that should be created? etc, fail 🔴. The ideal user story structure # In the real world sometimes we can’t return things to the backlog if they are not ready, deadlines need to be met and a story like this needs to be “refined along the way”, let’s analyze this story and refine it the most possible.\nThe questions # Fruit name: What are the character limits for the fruit name? instead of a text box, should not be a selection box showing all the fruits offered by the business? Country: Why the country is not a selection box? Parent brand: Where do the values for the parent brand come from? should be hardcoded?, or come from an API service? does this service exist? Quantity: What’s the minimum and maximum quantity of fruits to be added to the basket? is this quantity the same for all the fruits offered by the business? (Possibly child) brand: Where do the values for a brand come from? Do the brands are related to the parent brand? what kind of cross-validation between parent and child brand exists?. What the hell is “items” in the items selection box? what’s the maximum or minimum of brands to be added? And finally, the create button, does the service for creating a basket exist? also, the ticket says create and edit, does this service handle the edit functionality too? The answers # We met with our Product owner, the designer, and the backend developer, after that we also got intel from real users and we brought clarity to the previous questions, leaving us with a beautifully crafted user story.\nTicket name: Create a new basket of fruits modal\nDesign:\nA better user story, Figma UI used Acceptance criteria\nList screen As a user, I’d like to create a new basket of fruit from the Basket fruit List Screen. Add a new basket button should show the Create a new basket of fruits modal. Fruits Fruits selection is a required field and its values come from Fruits service. The country is a required field, we should reuse the existing Country Component. Quantity Quantity is a required field and is an integer between 1 and 10. Brands Parent brand selection is a required field and its values come from Brands service. Children\u0026rsquo;s brand\u0026rsquo;s selection and branches are required fields and its values come from Brands service. I’d like to select a parent brand before being able to add or modify children\u0026rsquo;s brands, at least one child brand with a branch should be selected. If I select a new parent branch the children\u0026rsquo;s branch should be rebooted to its initial state. Create The previous validation should be met so I can create a correct basket of fruit. Loading and Error states Loading and error handling should use the same pattern used throughout the application. Dependencies\nCovered Loading and error state mechanism, ticket link. Basket fruit List Screen, ticket link. Get Fruits service, service swagger documentation. Get Brands service, service swagger documentation (for both parent and children brands).
